== The python/ directory ==
It contains unit tests for the bindings-specific code. If it can be tested on
the C level it shouldn't be here.

== The repos/ directory ==
This directory contains sample package data for testing. The goal is to have as
few packages as possible, ideally one or two per a specific testing role they
can play:

flying
* installed at a version older than anything from repositories

fool
* installed version available from main repo, updates repo contains a newer version

penny, penny-lib
* have summaries

walrus
* not installed, available in the main repo
