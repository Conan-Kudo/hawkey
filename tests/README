== The python/ directory ==
It contains unit tests for the bindings-specific code.

== The repos/ directory ==
This directory contains sample package data for testing. The goal is to have as
few packages as possible, ideally one or two per a specific testing role they
can play:

flying
* installed at a version older than anything from repositories

fool
* installed version available from main repo, updates repo contains a newer version
* the updates version obsoletes "penny"

penny, penny-lib
* have summaries
* penny-lib is architecture dependent

walrus
* not installed, available in the main repo

=== repos/yum ===

To test loading of yum repos we need an actual yum repo. It currently consists
of two packages ("mystery", "tour") and generated repodata. The specfiles are
included, all the package payload is generated in them. To rebuild them:

  rpmbuild -bb tour.spec
