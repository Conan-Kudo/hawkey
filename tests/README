== The python/ directory ==
module/ contains the hawkey.test module used for testing Python bindings of hawkey and its Python clients.

tests/ contains the unit tests themselves.

== The repos/ directory ==
This directory contains sample package data for testing. It is crucial to
maintain integrity of packages as described by the .repo files, for instance the
same (equal NEVRA) package present in two different repos needs to keep the same
provides and requires at both places.

The goal is to have as few packages as possible, ideally one or two per a
specific testing role they can play:

flying
* installed at a version older than anything from repositories

fool
* installed version available from main repo, updates repo contains a newer version
* the updates version obsoletes "penny"

penny, penny-lib
* have summaries
* installed in the highest available version
* penny-lib is architecture dependent
* 'penny-lib' provides 'P-lib' that 'flying' needs, so it can not be removed by itself.

walrus
* not installed, available in the main repo

hello
* depends on 'goodbye' which is not provided by anything else

=== repos/yum ===

To test loading of yum repos we need an actual yum repo. It currently consists
of two packages ("mystery", "tour") and generated repodata. The specfiles are
included, all the package payload is generated in them. To rebuild them:

  rpmbuild -bb tour.spec
